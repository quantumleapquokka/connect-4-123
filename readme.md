The implementation for this was built using the TicTacToe .h and .cpp files as a structural reference for the overall game flow, required virtual functions, and state management. The board setup, state string representation, and winner detection follow the same design pattern, but the win logic was expanded from three in a row to four in a row by scanning horizontal, vertical, and both diagonal directions across the 7×6 grid. The AI is based on the Negamax approach used in the TicTacToe AI assignment, but with an extended larger search space and aded alpha-beta pruning.
The game is playable by 2 people and vs an AI. the current code in the github is a person vs. AI, but could just be changed to either setting with the function gameHasAI().
